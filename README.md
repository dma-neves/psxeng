# psxeng
- Simple PS1 (PSX) game engine
- Not really a fully fledged game engine. Just a set of modules (graphics, input, etc) to develop a psx game.
- Main reference: http://lameguy64.net/tutorials/pstutorials/index.html
- Developed using PSn00bSDK. For some reason it only compiles and executes correctly when using release [v0.19](https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK/releases/tag/v0.19)
- Work in progress

## 3D stuff is now working
