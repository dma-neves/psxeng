# psxeng
- Simple PS1 (PSX) game engine
- Not really a fully fledged game engine. Just a set of modules (graphics, input, etc) to develop a psx game.
- Main reference: http://lameguy64.net/tutorials/pstutorials/index.html
- Developed using PSn00bSDK.
- Not working correctly with psxe anymore. Works fine using duckstation.
- Work in progress.
